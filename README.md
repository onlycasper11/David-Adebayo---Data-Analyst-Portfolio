# David-Adebayo--Data-Analyst-Portfolio
## About
### Hi, I'm David Adebayo üëã

I‚Äôm a data analyst with a strong foundation in public health and a focus on using data to drive positive change. My journey into health informatics started with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Public Health, where I developed a keen interest in how data can transform decision-making and improve health outcomes. Working with JSI on the MRITE project as a Monitoring and Evaluation Associate deepened my hands-on experience with data analytics in public health settings and strengthened my commitment to using data to make a measurable impact.

Currently, I‚Äôm expanding my expertise through a master‚Äôs program in health informatics, diving deeper into the technical aspects of data management, statistical analysis, and visualization. I enjoy bringing stories out of numbers, creating dashboards that simplify complex information, and sharing insights that support impactful health initiatives. From coding in Python and SQL to crafting visual narratives in Power BI, I‚Äôm driven by a desire to make data both accessible and actionable.

Outside of work, I‚Äôm a lifelong Manchester United fan (even through the tough seasons!) and love a good challenge‚Äîwhether it's exploring a new data tool, brainstorming with friends, or solving open-ended analytics problems. I believe that learning is a journey, and I‚Äôm always excited to connect with others who are passionate about public health, data, and making a difference.
